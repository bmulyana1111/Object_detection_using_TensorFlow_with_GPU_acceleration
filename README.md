This code includes GPU acceleration for improved performance.
It utilizes TensorFlow's GPU support by setting the appropriate device for execution.
The tf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth function is used to allocate GPU memory dynamically, ensuring efficient memory utilization.
Input file is 'input_image.jpg' with the path to your input image. The necessary dependencies, including TensorFlow with GPU support, CUDA, and cuDNN, must properly installed for GPU acceleration to work
